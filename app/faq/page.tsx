      <HA2 id="rollback">Does Project+ have Rollback?</HA2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Project+ does not have rollback netcode. While it has
        been heavily anticipated since the release of Slippi for Melee, Project+
        faces significant barriers to the development of rollback netcode with
        its size, complexity, and the lack of available manpower. The ongoing
        Brawlback project seeks to implement rollback netcode and matchmaking
        into Super Smash Bros. Brawl and its mods such as Project+. There is
        currently no timetable for its completion and release.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brawlback and its development are not associated with the Project+
        development team or this website. If you would like to learn more about
        Brawlback or support its development, you can join the Brawlback Discord
        community on the <Link href="/find-communities">Find Communities</Link>{" "}

      <HA2 id="project-m">Is Project+ the continuation of Project M?</HA2>
      <p>
        Project+ is not an official continuation of Project M. Project M is the
        work of the PMDT which disbanded in 2015. Project+ doesn't use
        unreleased PMDT assets unless given permission by the original creators.

      <p>
        Tournament organizers decide which game, version, and rules their
        tournament will be using. Some regions primarily play the latest version
        of Project+ while some play the final official version of Project M. You
        can use the community map to find links to socials for your local
        community to help you get started and find tournaments near you.

      <Note>
        TODO: Consolidate this entry into the{" "}
        <Link href="/ntsc-pal">NTSC / PAL</Link> page.
      </Note>
      <p>
        NTSC is one of several audio and visual standards for TV systems and
        NTSC-U refers specifically to the United States variant. Game developers
        engineered specific versions of games and systems to match the video
        systems of specific regions, so there are differences that make a
        mismatch of regional games and consoles incompatible. Project M and
        Project+ are designed for the NTSC-U versions of the Wii and Super Smash
        Bros. Brawl, so they are incompatible with versions from other regions
        (such as the PAL version that is prominent in Europe).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          You can play Project M and Project+ as well as any other Brawl mod on
          any system using the{" "}

      <p>
        To check the compatibility of your Brawl ISO, you need to check its MD5
        in Dolphin. From the Dolphin window, right click on Brawl and select{" "}
        <code>Properties</code>, navigate to the <code>Info</code> tab, and then
        click the <code>Compute</code> button located to the right of{" "}
        <code>MD5 Checksum</code> as seen in this{" "}
        <a href="https://imgur.com/xzye9my">screenshot</a>.

      <p>Compatible ISOs may include:</p>

      </ul>

    <section>
      <HA2 id="l-canceling">Does Project+ have L-Canceling?</HA2>
      <p>
        Yes. L-Cancelling is a technique from earlier games in the series and
        Project M where pressing a shield input before landing during an aerial
        attack reduces the landing lag. In Project+ you can L-Cancel within 7
        frames of landing to reduce the landing lag by half.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, "Auto L-Cancel" can be toggled on from the match settings to
        automatically reduce the landing lag of aerials without the need to
        perform an L-Cancel. Auto L-Cancel is great for new or casual players or
        when you want a consistently fast gameplay experience. It also makes the
        game a bit less stressful on the hands, which can be an accessibility
        factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tournaments, it is up to tournament organizers to determine if their
        tournament will run with "Auto L-Cancel" toggled on or off.
